## Features of Slick

The slick programming-language is quick evolving and mantaining a clean ecosystem. Some core features and ideas of mantra are listed below:

- Syntax inspired by **Ruby, Erlang, Elixir, Lisp and Dylan**
- Fully redundant actor-model
- Compiling down to BEAM bytecode
- Access to any existing erlang method and the OTP
- Pattern-matching (work-in-progress)
- Lazy code-evaluation (work-in-progress)
- Lisp like macros for extending the language
- And many more features...

**You can find samples of using the language under <a href="https://github.com/timo-cmd2/mantra/examples">/examples/</a>**

> Note: Slick is a work-in-progress, so many features are still not yet implemented

## Installing Slick

The simplest way to get Slick installed on your system is to fire up a unix-like shell and type:

> Note: The installation requires git and elixir/mix installed

```bash
git clone https://github.com/timo-cmd2/slick.git slick 
cd slick
mix deps.get
mix compile
```
